Q 1 : What is Linear Regression?
Ans : A supervised learning algorithm used for regression problems.

Q 2 : Which of the following is NOT an assumption of Linear Regression?
Ans : Linearity

Q 3 : What is Multiple Regression?
Ans : A supervised learning algorithm used for regression problems involving multiple
independent variables.

Q 4 : Which of the following is an advantage of Multiple Regression over Simple Linear
Regression?
Ans : More accurate predictions

Q 5 : What is Polynomial Regression?
Ans : A supervised learning algorithm used for regression problems that model the
relationship between the response variable and the independent variable as an nth
degree polynomial.

Q 6 : Which of the following is NOT an assumption of Polynomial Regression?
Ans : Homoscedasticity

Q 7 : What is the coefficient of determination (R-squared) used for in Linear Regression?
Ans : To measure the goodness of fit of the model.
